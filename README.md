This repo contains the code for a UX rich performant and accessible porfolio site. The website is built using HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JavaScript and it doesn't uses any CSS or JavaScript libraries or frameworks. Everyone is welcome :blush: to use it as template for their own portfolio but you can't claim that it's your design.
